*Note: The backend for this service is hosted on Railway's free tier, meaning first time requests can take 5-10s to generate a response


Convolutional Neural Network made in Pytorch trained on MNIST Dataset. Backend made with FastAPI and hosted on [Railway](https://railway.com/), frontend hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

AI has ~97% accuracy on MNIST Dataset. To get more accurate results in demo, allow numbers to take up the majority of the canvas.
